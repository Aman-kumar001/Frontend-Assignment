# Form Creator with UI Schema
## UI Schema:
A UI schema is basically an object literal providing information on how the form should be rendered, while the JSON schema tells what.

## How I am doing this?
I have used recursion to go through all the groups of fields and render them on screen using conditions based on their UI type.
This is done in the file ItemRender.js . 

## How can we run it?
#### It is very simple to run this code.
#### 1 Download or clone all the files in to the system.
#### 2 open the the code editor.
#### 3 Run command 'npm install', this will install all the dependencies in the system.
#### 4 Now it is ready to render the stuff on your display. Run command 'npm run start' and KABOOMðŸ’¥ its on your screen.
